# Homework 4
- Apply Support Vector Machines (SVMs) on normalized and non-nomralized data sets
- Use linear and Gaussian kernels
- Change the parameters of C and Gamma and graph the combination results
# Homework 5
- Apply neural networks with 2 hidden layers on scaled and unscaled data
- Use different values for number of units and alpha parameters to regularize the data
- Use different activation functions (logistic, tanh, relu)

# Project
- Using the Auction data set
- Analyze and predict the outcomes of an online auction
# Project 1
- Written report of the data analysis (not included)
# Project 2
- Clean data set and replace missing values
- Mean, median, and standard deviation
- Draw boxplots and pairplots
- Draw scatterplots and find the correlation between variables
# Project 3
- Split the data into train and test sets
- Perform regression and calculate the coefficent of determination (R2 score) between variables
- Use scatterplots to visualize the regression and R2 scores
# Project 4
- Use agglomerative, k-means, mini-batch k-means, and mean-shift clustering methods
- Use the classification methods of logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines
